Changing lane

calcualte the cost of each lane

decide the best lane based on potential speed and safety
have a bias towards the inside lane, so that if not overtaking you are in inside lane

if best lane is not an adjancent lane then treat it as 2 seperate lane changes
- mean need to have slightly different cost calcualtions here. i.e do we need to check the safety of the 2nd of the changes to start with?
